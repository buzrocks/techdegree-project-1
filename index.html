        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I have worked my entire life on computer hardware and providing tech support. I began my career long before entering the workforce fueled by the drive and passion I have for computers, technology and the people it serves. Having a solid foundation in computer hardware and repair is a huge asset and will definitely help as I transition into front end web development.</p>

<!-- I changed the default h2 text from "Goals" to "Looking Ahead" and changed the paragraph text. I added a horizontal rule, and I also changed a few of the li skills to things I want to learn. I added an image after the paragraph as well -->

        <p>As I dive deeper into the world of software development, I hope to gain knowledge in the following areas:</p>

          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using the above technologies, I hope to bring world-class service to the industry as a whole.</p>
