# techdegree-project-1
Hello and welcome to my first project! Thank you for taking the time to have a look.<br>
I'm hoping to earn an exceeds and extra credit. I added some CSS properties, an extra page and some images.<br>
I've noted the changes I made to the code directly on the source using comments like this:<br>

The project is also hosted at my website <a href="http://www.buzrocks.com/project1"> here </a> (opens in same window)<br>
